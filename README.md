# Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains the files for the Portfolio task for COMP2200/6200 in S2 2021. 

## Portfolio one
Portfolio one has 4 datasets which was analysed with line graphs and descriptive statistics. The datasets revolved around cycling data recording the distance travelled, speed, elevation and much more. Descriptive statistics such as mean, median and standard deviation was calculated. 

## Portfolio two
Portfolio two is an analysis of one dataset which was combined from two datasets. The analysis was mostly data visualisation with heatmaps, bar graphs and scatter plots included in the analysis. A Pariplot and a correlation matrix was produced to identify if an LGA with higher participation in the sports voucher scheme was also higher on the economic measurement.
	
## Portfolio three
Portfolio three was an analysis on a single dataset with many variables, both categorical and numerical. Basic exploration of the data was completed through column graphs and boxplots. Label encoder was also used to convert categorical string data to an integer. So that the logistic regression model could be built. The dataset was spilt into a train set with 70% of the data and a test set with 30% of the data. The random state of 142 was used to keep the model consistent and replicable. A confusion matrix was plotted to see how many false positives and false negatives there were in the model. An RFE was also included in the analysis to see which features were the best for the model.
